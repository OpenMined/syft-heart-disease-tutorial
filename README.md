  <h1><strong>Study Heart Disease using PySyft</strong></h1>
</div>

### Welcome! 

In this tutorial we will use PySyft to study heart disease, and by doing so 
we will try to answer the following question: 

> Can we run data science and Machine Learning experiments on _multiple_ and _distributed_ medical data, _without seeing the data_?

We are going to to learn _how_! 
All you need to get started is PySyft, and a Jupyter notebook! üöÄ

## Getting Started

### 1. Download the code locally

Using the `git` command from the terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/openmined/syft-heart-disease-tutorial
```

or by clicking on `Code >> Local >> Download ZIP` on the repository main page.

### 2. Install PySyft and ML Packages

The repository includes a `requirements.txt` file with the list of 
all the Python packages required to work with the notebooks. 
You can install all these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please refer to the [Quick Install](https://docs.openmined.org/en/latest/quick-install.html) guide to learn how to install PySyft. 

**Note**: It is recommended to install PySyft and all the dependencies within a dedicated Python virtual environment 
(using the _virtual-env_ manager of choice, e.g. [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/), [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))

#### 3. Launch the Datasites

Setup and launch the PySyft Datasites using the `launch_datasites.py` script included in the repository. From the command line:

```bash
$ python launch_datasites.py
```

**Note**: Please, keep the terminal open, as this will keep all the servers running in background. You can stop all the servers, and terminate
the program by typing `Ctrl+C`.

    Use PySyft to train a Machine learning classifier, using data across the four distributed datasites, and _without seeing the data_!

    Create an Ensemble using all the models trained remotely and independently on each dataset. We will test this strategy to obtain
    a ML predictive model that has seen `4x` more medical data in training.

## Data Description

We will use the **full** version of the Heart Disease dataset, as available on [UCI ML](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

This database is the result of a study for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, as presented in this [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/International-application-of-a-new-probability-for-Detrano-J%C3%A1nosi/a7d714f8f87bfc41351eb5ae1e5472f0ebbe0574).

The _full_ dataset contains the data as collected by patients in four different hospitals, in 1988: 
- Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio (303 patients);
- Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, Hungary (425 patients);
- Veterans Administration Medical Center in Long Beach, California (200 patients)
- University Hospitals in Zurich and Basel (143 patients).

Each Hospital will correspond to a single PySyft Datasite, hosting their corresponding version of the `Heart Study Data`.

### Notes

This dataset is quite popular, and well-known in the data science/machine learning community. However, only the Cleveland database is the one that has been effectively used by ML researchers to date [1](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.  It is integer valued from `0` (no presence) to `4`. In our Machine learning experiments we will treat this problem as a _binary_ (`presence` vs `absence`) classification problem.

#### Acknowledgments

The authors of the dataset have requested that any use of the data include the names of the principal investigator responsible for the data collection at each institution. They would be:

- Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
- University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
- University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
- V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation:Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.
